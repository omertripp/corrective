% This is "sig-alternate.tex" V2.1 April 2013
% This file should be compiled with V2.5 of "sig-alternate.cls" May 2012
%
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V2.5 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.5) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.
%
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex source is an example which *does* use
% the .bib file (from which the .bbl file % is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission, you *NEED* to 'insert'
% your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.
%
% ================= IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS =======================
% Questions regarding the SIGS styles, SIGS policies and
% procedures, Conferences etc. should be sent to
% Adrienne Griscti (griscti@acm.org)
%
% Technical questions _only_ to
% Gerald Murray (murray@hq.acm.org)
% ===============================================================

% For tracking purposes - this is V2.0 - May 2012

	\begin{abstract}
		Concurrency control is a challenging problem. While some thread interleavings are admissible, there are certain interleaving scenarios that lead to inadmissible program states. Broadly speaking, there are two main paradigms for avoiding such situations: \emph{pessimistic synchronization} reduces parallelism to mitigate interference between threads, while \emph{optimistic synchronization} detects when illegal interleavings have occurred and rolls execution (of one or more threads) back to an admissible point.
		
		We propose a novel synchronization paradigm. In our approach, dubbed \emph{corrective synchronization}, the correctness of multithreaded execution is enforced neither by reducing parallelism nor by rolling back illegal thread interleavings, but by correcting the inadmissible state after the fact. The system automatically compensates, if necessary, for the effects of inadmissible interleavings by modifying the program state as a transaction completes while accounting for the behavior of concurrent transactions. We have proven that corrective synchronization is serializable.
		
		Within the general scope of corrective synchronization, we explore the combination of (i) an offline static analysis to compute correct states w.r.t. the entry states with (ii) a runtime protocol that utilizes the artifacts computed statically to perform online state correction. We instantiate this setup to clients of the Java {\sf ConcurrentMap} abstract data type (ADT) to ensure safe composition of map operations.
		
		We have created a prototype implementation of this system in Java, which we compare against two mainstream techniques: a lock-based approach boosted with abstract {\sf Map} semantics as well as a standard software transactional memory (STM). Our experimental evaluation on several real-world benchmarks indicates x2 speedup improvement compared to these techniques. Further, our technique incurs negligible overhead as compared to the original execution.
