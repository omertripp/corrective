\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

We have presented an alternative to the lock- and retry-based synchronization methods, which we dub \emph{corrective synchronization}. The key insight is to correct a bad execution, rather than aborting/retrying the transaction or conservatively avoiding the bad execution in the first place. We have explored, and experimented with, an instantiation of corrective synchronization for composed operations over ${\sf ConcurrentMap}$s, where correct states are computed via offline static analysis. Our initial results show promise.

In the future, we intend to define, and experiment with, more variants of corrective synchronization. As part of that, we plan to develop compositional synchronization methods that integrate corrective synchronization with lock- and STM-based synchronization.
